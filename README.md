Core Image Filter explorer

*Filterpedia* is an iPad app for exploring (almost) the entire range of image filters offered by Apple's Core Image framework. It is designed as a companion app to my upcoming book, _Core Image for Swift_ which is due for publication in February 2016. 

The UI is split into two sections: the table view on the left allows the user to navigate through and select a filter, the panel on the right then displays all the parameters of the selected filter which can be adjusted using horizontal sliders.
